This workspace contains a FastAPI backend (Python) and a SvelteKit frontend (TypeScript/Svelte) for an envelope budgeting app. Prioritize modular, maintainable, and containerisable such as in docker . Use SQLite for persistence and JWT for authentication. Frontend should use Tailwind CSS for styling.
